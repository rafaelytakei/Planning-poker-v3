# Planning Poker v3

Rework of [v2](https://github.com/rafaelytakei/Planning-Poker-v2) with some notable changes on the code:

- Using Pinia for state management: v2's code started to become too confusing at certain point without a store.
- TS over JS
- TDD (needs to be tested)
- WindiCSS over PrimeVue
- Locale (en & pt-BR)
